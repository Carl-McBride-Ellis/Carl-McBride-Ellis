### I am a machine learning practitioner, particularly interested in the predictive modelling of tabular data.
Most of my work can be found on kaggle, where I maintain a [list of my notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/carlmcbrideellis/index-of-my-kaggle-notebooks).
Previously I worked as an academic researcher in the field of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, and a list of the publications that I have co-authored can be found on my [home page](https://carl-mcbride-ellis.github.io/). I am also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carl-mcbride-ellis/).

Needless to say everything I do is built on the work of others, 
and the vast majority of the source of the packages can be found here on Github, for example:
* [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn)
* [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy)
* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev)
* [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy)
* [statsmodels](https://github.com/statsmodels)
* [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost)
* [TabNet](https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet)
* [keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras)
* [cuML](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml)

### Visualization
* [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib)
* [seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn)
* [plotly](https://github.com/plotly)

All the best,<br>
