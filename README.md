### I am a machine learning practitioner, specialising in the predictive modelling of tabular data.
Examples of some my published work can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/carlmcbrideellis), where I maintain a [selection of my notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code/carlmcbrideellis/a-selection-of-my-kaggle-notebooks).
Previously I worked as an academic researcher in the field of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, and a list of the publications that I have co-authored can be found on my [home page](https://carl-mcbride-ellis.github.io/) (h-index=23). If you wish to get in touch it would be a pleasure to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carl-mcbride-ellis/).

Needless to say a great deal of what I do is facilitated by the work of others, 
and the vast majority of the source of the python packages can be found right here on GitHub, for example:
* [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn)
* [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy)
* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev) / [polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars)
* [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy)
* [statsmodels](https://github.com/statsmodels)
* [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) / [CatBoost](https://github.com/catboost/catboost) / [LightGBM](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM)
* [TabNet](https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet)
* [MAPIE](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/MAPIE)
* [keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras)
* [cuML](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml)

### Visualization
* [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib)
* [plotly](https://github.com/plotly)
* [seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn)

along with
