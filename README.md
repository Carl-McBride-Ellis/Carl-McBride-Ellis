### I am a machine learning practitioner, specialising in the predictive modelling of tabular data.
Examples of some my published work can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/carlmcbrideellis), where I maintain a [selection of my notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code/carlmcbrideellis/a-selection-of-my-kaggle-notebooks), I am 
also author of ["The Orange Book of Machine Learning"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Carl-McBride-Ellis/TOBoML/main/TOBoML.pdf).
Previously I worked as an academic researcher in the field of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, and a list of the over 40 publications that I have co-authored can be found on my [home page](https://carl-mcbride-ellis.github.io/) (h-index=24).

My primary skills are:

- data exploration and experimentation
- predictive modelling of tabular / structured data using the tools of machine learning
- proof of concept (PoC)  prototype models
- regression techniques with conformal prediction intervals
- well calibrated probabilistic classification

Needless to say a great deal of what I do is made possible by the groundwork of others, 
and the vast majority of the source of the python packages can be found right here on GitHub, for example:

* [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy) / [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy)
* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev) / [polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars)
* [statsmodels](https://github.com/statsmodels)
* [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn)
* [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) / [CatBoost](https://github.com/catboost/catboost) / [LightGBM](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM)
* [quantile-forest](https://github.com/zillow/quantile-forest) and [MAPIE](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/MAPIE)
* [TabPFN](https://github.com/PriorLabs/TabPFN) by [Prior Labs](https://priorlabs.ai/)

#### Visualization
* [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib) / [plotly](https://github.com/plotly) / [seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn) along with [missingno](https://github.com/ResidentMario/missingno)

all facilitated from within the [JupyterLab computational environment](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab).
